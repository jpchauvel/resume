\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scotiabank's mobile banking}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I was involved in the development of the iOS app. This time around using Objective-C.
            \item Given that it was a legacy app, didn’t have any kind of automated test and was about to be superseded by the Joy project, I did not use any kind of automated test in this project.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Tools:} Objective-C, Swift 4.1, Carthage, Git
    \item \textbf{Tribal Planet's MPACT}
        \newline{}
        \url{https://www.tribalplanet.com}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I was the main architect of the project and also the lead developer of the backend maintenance.
            \item As a TDD practitioner, I covered every change I did with unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
            \item I built the continuous deployment pipeline first for CircleCI then for AWS EKS.
            \item Offloaded every single piece of code that can be taken of requests into Celery jobs.
            \item Applied asynchronous requests with asyncio and Uvicorn.
            \item I built an automated moderation system for user-generated content with AWS Rekognition and Azure Cognitive Services.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Tools:} Python, asyncio, Flask, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, MongoDB, Mock, Git, Docker
    \item \textbf{Goodyear's AndGo}
        \newline{}
        \url{https://www.andgonow.com}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I created technical specs based on product requiremnts, this include technical diagrams (UML, ERD, etc), DB schemas \& contracts. To better communicate with technical team members and stakeholders.
            \item As a TDD practitioner, I covered every change I did with unit, integration and end-to-end tests. The coverage remained consistently at 90\%.
            \item I was involved in a breaking change that required splitting a monolith service into disparate microservices. The important part was that I had to carefuly plan the redesign of the new arquitecture of the DB schema.
            \item I was in charge of developing a new important feature that required the creation of calendar events that would trigger the running of some processes in the future.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Tools:} Python, asyncio, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Mock, Git, Docker, Microservices
